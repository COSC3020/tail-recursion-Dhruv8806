# Tail Recursion

In the lectures, we've seen code for a recursive implementation for computing
the Fibonacci numbers. Make this implementation tail-recursive. I have not
provided a template; depending on how you choose to implement the function, it
will have a different signature. I have also not provided any test code, but you
can base yours on test code from other exercises.

Hint: It may help to have a look at the iterative dynamic programming
implementation. What changes between iterations of the loop?

## Runtime Analysis

Is the asymptotic complexity of tail-recursive Fibonacci different from the
non-tail-recursive version? Why, or why not? Add your answer, including your
reasoning, to this markdown file.

## My Analysis

The asymptotic complexity of tail-recursive Fibonacci and the non - tail-recursive version is same, as both have a time complexity of $\Theta(n)$. In both ways $n$ indicates the number of steps the algorithm needs to perform as to calculate the Fibonacci number. Overall, both versions have the same asymptotic complexity of $\Theta(n)$, with handling each recursive call linearly one step at a time.
